def _np_reshape(a, newshape, order='C'):
    """Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Array to be reshaped.
    newshape : int or tuple of ints
        The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
        an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
        One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is
        inferred from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.
    order : {'C'}, optional
        Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the
        elements into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C'
        means to read / write the elements using C-like index order,
        with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
        axis index changing slowest. Other order types such as 'F'/'A'
        may be added in the future.

    Returns
    -------
    reshaped_array : ndarray
        It will be always a copy of the original array. This behavior is different
        from the official NumPy package where views of the original array may be
        generated.

    ----------
    a : ndarray

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray

    repeats : int or array of ints
        The number of repetitions for each element.  `repeats` is broadcasted
        to fit the shape of the given axis.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to repeat values.  By default, use the
        flattened input array, and return a flat output array.

def _npi_multinomial(a):
    """Draw samples from a multinomial distribution.

    The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalisation of the binomial distribution.
    Take an experiment with one of ``p`` possible outcomes. An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice,
    where the outcome can be 1 through 6. Each sample drawn from the distribution represents n such experiments.
    Its values, ``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_p]``, represent the number of times the outcome was ``i``.


    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of experiments.
    pvals : sequence of floats, length p
        Probabilities of each of the p different outcomes. These should sum to 1
        (however, the last element is always assumed to account for the remaining
        probability, as long as ``sum(pvals[:-1]) <= 1)``.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then ``m * n * k`` sam-
        ples are drawn. Default is None, in which case a single value is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The drawn samples, of shape size, if that was provided. If not, the shape is ``(N,)``.
        In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional value drawn from the distribution.

def _np_cumsum(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None):
    """
    Return the cumulative sum of the elements along a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. The default
        (None) is to compute the cumsum over the flattened array.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  If `dtype` is not specified, it defaults
        to the dtype of `a`, unless `a` has an integer dtype with a
        precision less than that of the default platform integer.  In
        that case, the default platform integer is used.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output
        but the type will be cast if necessary. See `doc.ufuncs`
        (Section "Output arguments") for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    cumsum_along_axis : ndarray.
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which case a reference to `out` is returned. The
        result has the same size as `a`, and the same shape as `a` if
        `axis` is not None or `a` is a 1-d array.

def _np_arctan2(x1, x2, out=None, **kwargs):
    r"""
    arctan2(x1, x2, out=None)

    Element-wise arc tangent of ``x1/x2`` choosing the quadrant correctly.

    The quadrant (i.e., branch) is chosen so that ``arctan2(x1, x2)`` is
    the signed angle in radians between the ray ending at the origin and
    passing through the point (1,0), and the ray ending at the origin and
    passing through the point (`x2`, `x1`).  (Note the role reversal: the
    "`y`-coordinate" is the first function parameter, the "`x`-coordinate"
    is the second.)  By IEEE convention, this function is defined for
    `x2` = +/-0 and for either or both of `x1` and `x2` = +/-inf (see
    Notes for specific values).

    This function is not defined for complex-valued arguments; for the
    so-called argument of complex values, use `angle`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1 : ndarray
        `y`-coordinates.
    x2 : ndarray
        `x`-coordinates. `x2` must be broadcastable to match the shape of
        `x1` or vice versa.
    out : ndarray or None optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or `None`,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned. 

    Returns
    -------
    angle : ndarray
        Array of angles in radians, in the range ``[-pi, pi]``.

    Notes
    -----
    *arctan2* is identical to the `atan2` function of the underlying
    C library.  The following special values are defined in the C
    standard: [1]_

    ====== ====== ================
    `x1`   `x2`   `arctan2(x1,x2)`
    ====== ====== ================
    +/- 0  +0     +/- 0
    +/- 0  -0     +/- pi
     > 0   +/-inf +0 / +pi
     < 0   +/-inf -0 / -pi
    +/-inf +inf   +/- (pi/4)
    +/-inf -inf   +/- (3*pi/4)
    ====== ====== ================

    Note that +0 and -0 are distinct floating point numbers, as are +inf
    and -inf.

    References
    ----------
    .. [1] ISO/IEC standard 9899:1999, "Programming language C."

    Examples
    --------
    Consider four points in different quadrants:

    >>> x = np.array([-1, +1, +1, -1])
    >>> y = np.array([-1, -1, +1, +1])
    >>> np.arctan2(y, x) * 180 / np.pi
    array([-135.,  -45.,   45.,  135.])

    Note the order of the parameters. `arctan2` is defined also when `x2` = 0
    and at several other special points, obtaining values in
    the range ``[-pi, pi]``:

    >>> x = np.array([1, -1])
    >>> y = np.array([0, 0])
    >>> np.arctan2(x, y)
    array([ 1.5707964, -1.5707964])
